# @ngbracket/ngx-layout

### The Angular team no longer publishes new releases of this project. Please see [this article](https://medium.com/@caerus.karu/farewell-flex-layout-aaa567023769) for the explanation and next steps.

This project is a port of @angular/flex-layout as this is still a very well used library and something I have used extensively in the past, and wanted to give something back to the Angular community by trying to keep this project alive for as long as possible.

If you would like to contribute to the project please get in touch with me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/duncanfaulkner). Alternatively, if you would like to sponsor the project details can be found on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/sponsors/ngbracket).

Thank you for your support.

### Getting Started

Start by installing the ngx-layout library from `npm`

```
npm i -s @ngbracket/ngx-layout @angular/cdk
```

Next, you'll need to import the Layout module in your app's module.

**app.module.ts**

```ts

import { FlexLayoutModule } from '@ngbracket/ngx-layout';
...

@NgModule({
    ...
    imports: [ FlexLayoutModule ],
    ...
});
```

After that is configured, you can use the ngx-layout attributes in your HTML tags for flex layout:

```html
<div fxLayout="row" fxLayoutAlign="space-between"></div>
```
